  "technique_description": "Search for triggers using Bayesian Optimization for Trojan classification. 1) A Bayesian optimizer proposes potential triggers to try given results from triggers tried so far. 2) Inference the model with the proposed triggers and record model activations. 3) Record triggers tried and model activations as features, and a Trojan classifier is trained to predict whether the model is Trojaned or not given features. ",
  "technique_changes": "We extracted a fixed trigger search schedule from the Bayesian Optimization model to greatly speed up processing, to better understand the challenges we are facing in sentiment classification and named entity recognition models. ",
